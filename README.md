## 📜 Description

CVE-2024-6387_Check is a lightweight, efficient tool designed to identify servers running vulnerable versions of OpenSSH, specifically targeting the recently discovered `regreSSHion` vulnerability (CVE-2024-6387). This script facilitates rapid scanning of multiple IP addresses, domain names, and CIDR network ranges to detect potential vulnerabilities and ensure your infrastructure is secure.

## 🌟 Features

- **Rapid Scanning**: Quickly scan multiple IP addresses, domain names, and CIDR ranges for the CVE-2024-6387 vulnerability.
- **Banner Retrieval**: Efficiently retrieves SSH banners without authentication.
- **Multi-threading**: Uses threading for concurrent checks, significantly reducing scan times.
- **Detailed Output**: Provides clear, emoji-coded output summarizing scan results.
- **Port Check**: Identifies closed ports and provides a summary of non-responsive hosts.

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
python CVE-2024-6387_Check.py <targets> [--port PORT] [--timeout TIMEOUT] [--list FILE]
```

### Examples

#### Single IP

```bash
python CVE-2024-6387_Check.py 192.168.1.1
```

#### IPs from a file

```bash
python CVE-2024-6387_Check.py -l ip_list.txt
```

#### Multiple IPs and Domains

```bash
python CVE-2024-6387_Check.py 192.168.1.1 example.com 192.168.1.2
```

#### CIDR Range

```bash
python CVE-2024-6387_Check.py 192.168.1.0/24
```

#### With Custom Port

```bash
python CVE-2024-6387_Check.py 192.168.1.1 example.com --port 2222
```

#### GCE VMs from project

```bash
python CVE-2024-6387_Check.py project/example-project
```

### Output

The script will provide a summary of the scanned targets:

* 🚨 Vulnerable: Servers running a vulnerable version of OpenSSH.
* 🛡️ Not Vulnerable: Servers running a non-vulnerable version of OpenSSH.
* ⚠️ Unknown: Servers running an unknown version of SSH
* 🔒 Closed Ports: Count of servers with port 22 (or specified port) closed.
* 📊 Total Scanned: Total number of targets scanned.
